1. Explain how the path for the orders file is constructed. That is, explain the parts of the path for the statement: $fp = fopen("$DOCUMENT_ROOT/../orders/orders.txt", 'w');
	$DOCUMENT_ROOT is a variable that stores the long path of $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'], which is the path for the document root of the server.  
	../ means the parent of, so in this case the parent directory of the document root directory.
	orders/ means the 'orders' directory that was in the previous directory.
	orders.txt means the 'orders.txt' file that is within the previous directory.  
	So the chain of events of this path was: go to the document root of the server, go up one directory, go down into the directory called 'orders', select the file orders.txt.
	
2. Why did the authors create a separate directory to contain the orders? 
	Because the previoius directory, the parent directory to the document root, is locked.
	
3. Consider @ $fp = fopen("$DOCUMENT_ROOT/../orders/orders.txt", 'ab'); What is the purpose of the @?
	The @ symbol tells PHP to supress any resulting errors from the function call.  This will keep the user from seeing these error messages.
	
1. When might you use fgetss?
	fgetss strips out any PHP and HTML tags.  This could be useful if you were using PHP to parse an input (file, textarea, etc.) that could have code that would be detrimental to your server.
